# 🤔 What is it?

This site is my university course project. The site is light, fast and easy to understand for any user.

# 🤨 What should he be able to do?

The site should provide a potential client with information about the types of insurance, contact information, information about the company and its news.

# 📚 Technology

Besides <span style="background-color: #B23621; color: #FFFFFF">HTML 5</span>, <span style="background-color: #0B4880; color: #FFFFFF">CSS 3</span> and some <span style="background-color: #CAC033; color: #000000">JavaScript 6</span>, the site is written using <span style="background-color: #4639B1; color: #FFFFFF">Bootstrap 4.5</span>, <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF; color: #72344A">Sass 3.5.5</span> and <span style="background-color: #0159B1; color: #FFFFFF">jQuery</span>.

# 👀 Important

1. The name of the site, logo, contact information, location of the main *office and information about insurance services are __not valid(!) and were used in the course project.__
2. On the "Contacts" page, the __feedback__ form __does not work!__
3. On the main page at the end of the news block, the __navigation__ bar is __made for beauty!__

# 🎁 Known bugs

- [ ] In mobile mode, in the menu, the language selection button extends beyond the edge of the screen.
- [ ] The text in the information cards about the types of insurance can slide down and are partially invisible.

_\*In fact, the address and location on the map is shawarma "Shawarmen #1" in the city of Odessa (Ukraine), where I tasted the most delicious shawarma. If you are passing through Odessa, then visit this place. You will not regret😄._
